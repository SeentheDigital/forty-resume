My name is Diaz Aditya Pratama and I am a graduate of University of Gadjah Mada working as a beginner Software Engineer or Developer in the Industry. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science which allows me to understand and develop software and computer programs that are required in this day and age. As technology becomes more and more sophisticated and ubiquitos over time it is important to know the process of how they work that is part of my job.

I have developed several small scale programs and applications such as a dashboard and simple data interpreters using various languages. Few of which are written in Python, C++, PHP and Javascript, with my knowledge of database management using mySQL and the markup languages of HTML & CSS. I am continusously learning these languages and some more in order to expand my tools to develop and write programs which will help me understand programming deeper.

My interests and hobbies asides from this are varied. If I have to choose three they would be music, reading and tennis. They are the things I am passionate about with my long term goal of gaining enough experience and deeper understanding of software development that I would like to create a game myself oneday.
